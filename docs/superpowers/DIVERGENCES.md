# Spec → Implementation Divergences

A running log of things a design spec (master or phase-level) committed to that were never
built, and were never recorded as a deliberate "deliberately out of scope" deferral at the time.
This is distinct from each phase spec's own honest non-goals list — those are decisions; this is
a gap-tracking mechanism so future phase reviews catch drift before it compounds.

Populated from the 2026-09-20 external review. Update this file whenever a future review, or a
phase's own retrospective, finds another one — and remove an entry once the gap is closed,
noting which phase closed it.

| Spec commitment | Source | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Workspace discovery via `--workspace` flag → `CAREEROS_WORKSPACE` env var → config file (three tiers) | Master §3 | Env var tier never implemented — only the flag and config-file tiers exist |
| Activity events carry a `reason` field ("why did CareerOS do that?") | Master §4.3 | Field exists on `ActivityEvent` but is never populated anywhere in the codebase |
| Activity event `status: "blocked"` | Master §4.3 | Never emitted — there's no policy engine yet to produce a blocked outcome (tracked as Phase 9) |
| `cat jobs/shortlisted/<id>.json` shows full match reasoning | Master §7, Phase 2 exit condition | Score and reasoning are computed and displayed at browse time, then discarded — `Job` has no field to persist either one |
| `careeros history` — a reader for the activity log | Master §8 | Never built. The audit trail exists (append-only, faithfully written) but has no command to read it back; `workspace status` shows only the most recent line |
| `careeros approvals`, `careeros settings`, `careeros discover`, `careeros jobs` | Master §8 | Not built as named — some functionality is covered under different command names (`job`, `browse`), some isn't covered at all (`approvals`, `settings`) |
| `CredentialProvider` interface for real external auth | Master §6, "Phase 3+" | Not built — `careeros/mailer.py` reads `os.environ` directly instead |
| `profile/skills.json` — "evidence-backed, each skill has source + date" | Master §4.2 | Partial: the `Skill` model has both fields, but `profile_extract` only ever sets `source="resume"` and never sets `last_used` |
| Outreach approval "blocks on send until approved" via an `approvals/` queue | Master §7, Phase 3 exit condition | Approval is a synchronous inline prompt (via `AgentRuntime.request_approval`), not a queue — functionally fine for a CLI, but means there's no `approvals/` directory for a future external runtime (Phase 12) to poll asynchronously |
| `discover-and-apply` is idempotent | Phase 6 spec §2 | False as shipped — `make_job_id` includes a random suffix and there's no dedup, so re-running against the same postings creates new `Job` records and can re-submit real applications. Asserted as a property, never tested. Gated pending Phase 9/10 (see `ROADMAP.md`) |
| Filler failure inside `discover-and-apply` logs "the same outcome `apply_cmd` does" | Phase 6 spec §6.5 | Not implemented as specified — the failure path was a bare `except Exception` with no activity event, fixed as part of addressing the 2026-09-20 review (see git history around that date for the fix commit) |
